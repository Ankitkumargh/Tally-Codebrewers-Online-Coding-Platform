                         ## Project Name:    Online Coding Platform
                                 // Commander of Full Stack //

## Project Objective

Code Deck is an advanced online IDE designed to offer developers a seamless coding experience, with features that enhance productivity and streamline the coding process. The project aims to provide a versatile playground where users can create, execute, and manage multiple code snippets efficiently. The core objectives of Code Deck include:

## Playground Area: 
Create an interactive playground where users can write and execute multiple code snippets, leveraging an online compiler and execution system powered by the Judge0 API.

## Code Editor Frontend:
Develop a responsive and intuitive code editor using ReactJS and the CodeMirror package to offer syntax highlighting and various language supports.

## Flexible Layout Structure:  
Implement a highly customizable and flexible layout using Styled Components, allowing users to personalize their coding environment.

## Judge0 API Integration:  
Set up and integrate Judge0 API through Rapid API to handle code compilation and execution seamlessly across multiple programming languages.

## Multi-Language Support:  
Enable support for various programming languages including C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

## Multi-Theme Support:  
Allow users to switch between different themes, enhancing usability and comfort during extended coding sessions.

## Upload and Download Functionality:   
Provide features for uploading code files to the editor and downloading code snippets, enabling easy code management.

## Input and Output Console:   
Equip the IDE with an input console where users can upload text files for input, and an output console for displaying and downloading execution results.

## Local Storage:  
Add functionality for saving multiple playground environments in the local storage, ensuring that users can retain their work between sessions.

## Fullscreen Support:  
Implement fullscreen support to offer a distraction-free coding environment.

## Technologies Used 
# React JS:  
The frontend of Code Deck is built with React JS, offering a modular and scalable framework that supports dynamic UI development.

# Styled Components:  
This library is used for styling, allowing for scoped CSS and a consistent design system across the application.

# Judge0 CE API:  
Judge0 is the core execution engine, facilitating code compilation and execution across multiple languages.

# Rapid API:  
Rapid API is used to configure and manage the Judge0 API, providing a reliable and scalable solution for API requests.

# Axios:  
Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests to the Judge0 API, ensuring smooth and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

# React Router:  
React Router is employed for handling client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation within the application.
